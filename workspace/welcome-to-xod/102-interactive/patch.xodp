Connect the Arduino to your computer.\n\n2. Upload the program with an interactive session. To do this, select Deploy â†’ Upload to Arduino from the main menu and mark \"Debug after upload\" checkbox or just click \"bug\" icon in the deployment pane below.\n\n3. After the interactive session has been started, select `tweak-boolean` and change its value. The built-in LED on the Arduino reacts to these changes.\n\nTo stop the interactive session press \"Stop\" button above, on the green panel. To start the interactive session again, you have to upload the program again.",
