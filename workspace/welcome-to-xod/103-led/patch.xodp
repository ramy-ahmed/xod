Let's examine how it works and let's play with its brightness.\n\nThe `LUM` pin on the `led` node accepts values between 0 and 1. The 0 value represents no glow at all, while a value of 1 denotes full brightness.\n\nHowever, you can adjust brightness level by setting values *between* 0 and 1 to the `LUM` pin.\n\nNote that LED can change the brightness only in the PWM output of your board. If you have an Arduino board, find out the port number with the leading \"~\" symbol.",

Set the value of the `PORT` pin to `D11`. Leading \"D\" means that it's a digital port.\n\n3. Replace `tweak-boolean` node with `tweak-number`.\n\n4. Upload the program with an interactive session.\n\n5. Change the value of the `tweak-number` in the range from 0 to 1 and see how the brightness of the LED is changing.",
